✳️ sicko is a speculative deisgn project developed for the Final Synthesis Laboratory C1 of Politenico di Milano (year 2021 - 2022) ✳️

We pictured a society where ever since your childhood you’re encouraged to hold back your emotions. 
Our goal is to subvert the dynamics that pressure you into the need of constant control and create a new generation of people who embrace every aspect of themselves, 
starting from rage.

 What if we, as a society, let go of our control issues and started expressing our true feelings when we feel them? 
 What if we took a feeling as frowned upon as anger and tried to normalize it? 

 This is how a new, outstanding experience is born. 
 This is how the possibility to get in touch with your darkest sides sees the light.
 
 sicko believes in competition and trusting your instincts. 
 sicko believes in tantrums. 
 sicko believes in taking pride in stubborness. 
 
 This is sicko.
