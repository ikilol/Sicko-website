                sicko is a company that, like some men, would just like to watch the world burn. 
                Founded in October 2021 by five fiery, passionate Italians, it all started with a question and some self-awareness.
                What if we, as a society, let go of our control issues and started expressing our true feelings when we feel them? What if we took a feeling as frowned upon as anger and tried to normalize it?
                Our ultimate goal is to create a society that can control its anger and channels it in a productive way, which as we know can mean to each his own.
                This is how a new, outstanding experience is born. This is how the possibility to get in touch with your darkest sides sees the light. 
                sicko believes in competition and trusting your instincts. sicko believes in tantrums. sicko believes in taking pride in stubborness. This is sicko.
