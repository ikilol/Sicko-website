                sicko is a company that, like some men, would just like to watch the world burn. Founded in October 2021 by five fiery, passionate Italians, it all started with a question and some self-awareness.
                What if we, as a society, let go of our control issues and started expressing our true feelings when we feel them? What if we took a feeling as frowned upon as anger and tried to normalize it?
                Our ultimate goal is to create a society that can control its anger and channel it in a “productive” way (and by that we mean venting it on an object rather than against the poor colleague at work).
                <br><br>
                This is how a new, outstanding experience is born. This is how the possibility to get in touch with your darkest sides sees the light. 
                sicko believes in competition and trusting your instincts. sicko believes in tantrums. sicko believes in taking pride in stubborness. This is sicko.

                    new generation of people who embrace every aspect of themselves, starting from rage.

                    something to hide, in a public and fucking loud practice.
